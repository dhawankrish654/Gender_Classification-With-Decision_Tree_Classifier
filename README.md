# Gender_Classification-With-Decision_Tree_Classifier
A Decision Tree Classifier which predicts the gender of a person on the basis of his/her first name.
Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.¶
There are 2 types of Classification:

-Binomial -Multi-Class Classification: Use Cases Some of the key areas where classification cases are being used:

1-To find whether an email received is a spam or ham

2-To identify customer segments

3-To find if a bank loan is granted

4-To identify if a kid will pass or fail in an examination

Types of Classification Algorithms Let’s have a quick look into the types of Classification Algorithm below.

1-Linear Models

-`Logistic Regression

-Support Vector Machines

2-Nonlinear models

-K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)

-Kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM)

-Naïve Bayes

-Decision Tree Classification

-Random Forest Classification

# In this classification we would be predicting the gender of a person on the basis of his/her first name with the help of DecisionTreeClassifier.
In a nutshell, the flow to building this model can be visualized as:

A name => Classifier => Male/Female

Note-The complete dataset is available in the repo.
